## Project Description
Night Stalker is a first-person parkour game where you gain new skills and abilities throughout consecutive attempts or "runs". The game is centered around running across the rooftops of a city while being chased by police. By utilizing various movement abilities, the player is able to evade these police for a time until they are caught. They will then attempt the escape again with more experienced and an all new procedurally-generated world each time. The goal of the game is to create a freeing and fast-paced experience for players, rewarding skillful movement with greater distance.
